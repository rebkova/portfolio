The aim of this weeks' assignment was to test our HTML and CSS skills a bit more and get started with cross-browser testing, accessibility and responsiveness of our website.

###tech used
Chrome extensions:
- Lighthouse in Chrome Dev tools (result: 93% Performance, 95% Accessibility, 85% Best practices, 91% SEO)
- ChromeVox Classic Extension screen reader

Other:
- WAVE: https://wave.webaim.org/ -> accessibility evaluation tool
- contrast ratio: https://contrast-ratio.com/ -> tool for ensuring the contrast ratio of colors used is high enough

##Accessibility testing:
- Checked HTML using validator.w3.org and fixed reported errors
- Checked the website with the ChromeVox Classic Extension screen reader. aria-hidden="true" attribute had to be added to some HTML tags containing decorative elements to prevent the screen reader from reading them.

Page is responsive in: 
- Google Chrome
